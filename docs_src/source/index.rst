lys_mat documentation
===================================

*lys_mat* is a Python-based library for crystal structures.

*lys_mat* can be used as an extension to *lys* (https://lys-devel.github.io/lys/index.html), a multi-dimensional data analysis and visualization platform.

To use *lys_mat*, go to :doc:`install`.
Source code of *lys_mat* is opened in GitHub (https://github.com/a-tock/lys_mat).

Characteristics:

- It is designed to be used in conjunction with *sympy* (https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), a Python library for symbolic mathematics.
- In lys_mat, crystal structure parameters can be treated as sympy objects.
- By combining this with simulation, it becomes possible to freely fit experimental data, and it is easy to determine crystal structures from experimental results.



Future vision

- Creation of a GUI tool that can visualize and edit crystal structures

This library is still under developement.
